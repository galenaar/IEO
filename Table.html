                <p>In 2012-13 a whopping 137,756 tonnes of televisions and computer kit were found discarded in Australia. This junk of electrical and electronic junk pile is now projected to grow to 181,000 tonnes by 2027-8. Of course, this number does not include other types of e-wastes like microwaves and DVD players that eventually make it to the nearby landfill. Australia is no exception. The issue of e-waste is already taking its toll on a large number of countries spread across the globe.<br>
                The apparent reluctance on the part of developed countries like the US and those in Europe to work out a global mitigation plan to control the menace and absence of stringent legislations to take the problem head on have further aggravated the situation. The International Labor Office (ILO) in its 2012 report ‘The Global Impact of E-waste, Addressing Challenge’ presented a sorry state of affair in so far as developed world’s seeming indifference to the problem go. It said the US is not bound by Basel Convention that controls the trans-boundary movement of hazardous waste and their disposal.

                <br>
                <p>Taking advantage of the loopholes, unscrupulous traders export large volume of e-waste to developing countries. According to ILO report 80 per cent of e-waste generated in developed world end up being shipped, often without any legal permission, for their recycling by hundreds and thousands of informal work force. According to a US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sponsored study, exporting e-waste to Asia (India, China) is 10 times cheaper than processing it in the US. This obviously points to the high-cost of processing the e-waste for their recycling.<br>
                The experts in E-waste management say that by 2018, there will be more PCs discarded in developing countries than in developed ones. Further, they say that by 2020 China and South Africa will account for 200 and 400 per cent increase respectively in e-waste generated from computer waste. In India’s case it will be a huge 500 per cent increase.

                <br>
                <p>The ILO has underlined the need for electrical and electronics manufacturers initiate steps to deal with e-waste at the design level of products. It says that it is imperative that Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) bill is passed and initial designs are encouraged to be green, long lived, upgradable and built for recycling. It also calls for protection of workers engaged in recycling hazardous e-waste through appropriate legal measures and formalization of the informal recycling sector.

                <br>
                <p>On the positive side of the development on E-waste management front, the US House of Representatives in 2011 mooted measures like Responsible Electronic Recycling Act aimed at restricting e-waste from being exported to India, China, Nigeria and other countries. Sweden accounting for collection of 17 Kg of e-waste per person per year is the second best country in e-waste management after Norway. In US some states have since passed –e-waste legislation, in the face of still opposition from a section. E-waste recycling certification like ‘e-stewards standards’ require companies to stop of export of e-waste to developing countries.

                <br>
                <p>The hazardous nature of e-waste is one of the rapidly growing environmental problems of the world. The ever-increasing amount of e-waste associated with the lack of awareness and appropriate skill is deepening the problem. A large number of workers are involved in crude dismantling of these electronic items for their livelihood and their health is at risk; therefore, there is an urgent need to plan a preventive strategy in relation to health hazards of e-waste handling among these workers in India. Required information should be provided to these workers regarding safe handling of e-waste and personal protection. For e-waste management many technical solutions are available, but to be adopted in the management system, prerequisite conditions such as legislation, collection system, logistics, and manpower should be prepared. This may require operational research and evaluation studies.
