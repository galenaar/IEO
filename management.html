                <p>Today, though, a growing amount of e-waste is not considered to be products that have stopped working or become obsolete.Technological advances are coming at us at such a dizzying speed that a lot of electronic devices that still work fine are the ones considered obsolete.Think of the many VCR players that got replaced when the DVD player hit the market, and now the DVD players getting replaced by Blu-ray players. If a product is powered electronically and someone thinks they can create a better version, that contributes to e-waste.And we care about this because, for years now, unwanted electronic devices have been filling landfills across the globe. In the U.S. alone, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that up to 60 million metric tons of e-waste end up in landfills every year.

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>For the recycling of e-waste, India heavily depends on the unorganized sector as only a handful of organized e-waste recycling facilities are available. Over 95% of the e-waste is treated and processed in the majority of urban slums of the country, where untrained workers carry out the dangerous procedures without personal protective equipment, which are detrimental not only to their health but also to the environment.<br>
                Recycling and treatment facilities require a high initial investment, particularly those fitted with technologically advanced equipments and processes. For the dismantling of one computer piece, these workers only get Rs. 5 or 10. For such a small amount, workers ruin their lives. Such “backyard recyclers” do not have wastewater treatment facilities, exhaust-waste gas treatment, and personal health protection equipment. Williams observed that despite significant attention from the media and enactment of some national level trade bans (most notably, China and India), the problem is apparently worsening. Therefore, health risk assessments are also required for the analysis of the consequences and of inappropriate management of end-of-life electronic wastes in developing countries.<br>
                While above ground, modern electronics are safe to use and be around. However, most electronics contain some form of toxic materials, including beryllium, cadmium, mercury, and lead, which pose serious environmental risks to our soil, water, air, and wildlife.When E-waste gets buried at a landfill, it can dissolve in microscopic traces into the gross sludge that permeates at the landfill. Eventually, these traces of toxic materials pool into the ground below the landfill. This is known as leaching.The more E-waste and metals at the landfill, the more of these trace toxic materials show up in the groundwater.

                <br>
                <p>In Environmental (Protection) Act 1986, the “polluter pays principle” is enacted to make the party responsible for producing pollution responsible for paying for the damage done to the natural environment.(24) In international environmental law, it is mentioned in principle 16 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. Polluter pays is also known as extended producer responsibility (EPR). Under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, central and state governments can enact legislations to safeguard the environment and people from exposure to toxic and hazardous nature of waste. Any violation of the provision of this act or notified rules is liable for punishment. Such penalty can be imposed on the violator if specific rules and regulations on e-waste are violated.<br>
                CPCB India is finalizing the set of rules and most recently issued a formal set of guidelines for proper and eco-friendly handling and disposal of the electronic waste. The Ministry of Environment and Forests is now processing the rules framed by electronics equipment manufacturers with the help of NGOs. According to the new guidelines issued by CPCB in 2007, e-waste is included in schedules 1, 2, and 3 of the “Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling) Rules 2003” and Municipal Solid Waste Management Rule, 2000. Each manufacturer of a computer, music system, mobile phone, or any other electronic gadget will be “personally” responsible for the final safe disposal of the product when it becomes a piece of e-waste. Department of Information Technology (DIT), Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, has also published and circulated a comprehensive technical guide on “Environmental Management for Information Technology Industry in India.” Demonstration projects have also been set-up by the DIT at the Indian Telephone Industries for the recovery of copper from Printed Circuit Boards.
                <br>
                As an effort to make the users aware of the recycling of e-waste, many electronic companies such as Apple, Dell, and HP have started various recycling schemes. Nokia India announced its “recycling campaign” for the Indian region. The program encouraged mobile phone users to dispose of their used handsets and accessories, irrespective of the brand, at any of the 1,300 green recycling bins put up across the priority dealers and care centers. Nokia is also planning to launch an electronic waste management program.<br>
                The Department of Environment, Delhi government, has also decided to involve ragpickers in general waste management in the capital. These ragpickers will be trained, given uniforms, ID cards, and hired to clean waste. The department also intends to involve eco-clubs, now running in over 1,600 government and private schools in the Capital, in this initiative since it is these eco-clubs that will be interacting with ragpickers of that particular area.</p>

                        <h3>LANDFILLING</h3>
                        <p>This is the most common methodology of e-waste disposal. Soil is excavated and trenches are made for burying the e-waste in it. An impervious liner is made of clay or plastic with a leachate basin for collection and transferring the e-waste to the treatment plant. However, landfill is not an environmentally sound process for disposing off the e-waste as toxic substances like cadmium, lead and mercury are released inside the soil and ground water.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>ACID BATH</h3>
                        <p>Acid bath involves soaking of the electronic circuits in the powerful sulphuric, hydrochloric or nitric acid solutions that free the metals from the electronic pathways. The recovered metal is used in the manufacturing of other products while the hazardous acid waste finds its ways in the local water sources.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <h3>INCINERATION</h3>
                        <p>This is a controlled way of disposing off the e-waste and it involves combustion of electronic waste at high temperature in specially designed incinerators. This e-waste disposal method is quite advantageous as the waste volume is reduced extremely much and the energy obtained is also utilized separately. However, it is also not free from disadvantages with the emission of the harmful gases mercury and cadmium in the environment.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <h3>REUSE</h3>
                        <p>This is the most desirable e-waste recycling process where with slight modifications the mobile phones, computers, laptops, printers can be reused or given as second hand product to the other person. The old electronic equipment can also be donated in the various charity programs and thus helping the persons in need. Moreover, there is a better way also by selling the old mobile phones or laptops to the some recycling and refurbishing companies. Several websites are acting as the middleman between recyclers and electronic users. It is a win-win situation for the users as they not only get rid off the old mobile phones but also get paid after reselling it.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>RECYCLING</h3>
                        <p>Mobile phones, monitors, CPUs, floppy drives, laptops, keyboards, cables and connecting wires can be re-utilized with the help of the recycling process. It involves dismantling of the electronic device, separation of the parts having hazardous substances like CRT, printed circuit boards  etc. and then recovery of the precious metals like copper, gold or lead can be done with the help of the efficient a powerful e-waste recycler. The most crucial thing here is choosing the right kind of recycler that does not break laws and handle the e-waste in the eco-friendly manner.Nowadays, there are many e-waste recycling companies coming up with the pick up facilities collecting obsolete electronic items from your homes. Moreover, they are also running several recycling programs for the users, retailers and manufacturers for the collection of the electronics. Certain agencies such as EPA, Earth 911, eCyclingCenter, Call2Recycle, GreenerGadgets and Electronic Industries Alliance are the additional resources for helping people in finding the nearby drop off locations.</p>
